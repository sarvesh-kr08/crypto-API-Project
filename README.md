# Crypto API project
This I created to show my command on Language like python and also to show that I'm fimiliar with packages like pandas and matplotlib
Step by step process of making this project is mention below:
1. Import all the neccessary libraries like pandas, matplotlib, json, requests, etc
2. Save the response into a variable called 'response' then convert it into json format and save it as 'data'
3. Normalize the data using pandas  and save it as 'df'
4. Created a function that pulls the request from the server using api and concatenate the data into the original data(df).
5. Using the function under the for loop after every 60 seconds of sleep which gives me and it keep happening till 333 times it gives me constant 6 hours of live feed of crypto movement.
6. Finally use this data to create visuals to represent the crypto movement
